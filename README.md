# CSSE351Final-Project
CSSE351 Computer Graphics final project

Plan is to be a viewable rotating solar system

Running the main code will display a crude solar system. The planets will rotate around the sun and reflect light off of whatever surface is facing the sun. While rotating around the sun, the planets also rotate around an axis.

Special for this project I made a large Colors file. With it, as long as you import it into your project, you can call specific colors you want to use by name instead of trying to remember the RGB color codes. I believe there are around ~200 available colors to call.
